### About
My name is Ahmed Hassan. I am a Computer Science undergrad specializing in the fields of Data Analytics and Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in Data and passion in utilizing data to discover meaningful insights I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data cleaning processing, data management, and statistical and exploratary data analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
