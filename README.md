My name is Ahmed Hassan. I am a Computer Science undergrad specializing in the fields of Data Analytics and Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in Data and passion in utilizing data to discover meaningful insights I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends.
